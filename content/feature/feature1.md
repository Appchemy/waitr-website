Get useful statistics about your sales. You do not need to wait for the end of the financial period to get your sales report because Waitr will automatically update it with every purchase.

Benefits of having a sales report:

You can have a real-time update of your business’s financial status and daily activities.

This can help you to:

**Determine your most profitable or slow-moving product.** 

Information regarding your products or services can assist you in allocating resources to either improve the product or to cater to your customer’s demands timely if the product is in high demand.

This information is also useful in determining opportunities and problems regarding the progress of products and services. For instance, low sales of a particular product could be as a result of an operational problem that needs to be solved.

**Get valuable information about your customers.**

As a business, you want to make sure that your customers are happy because happy customers will turn into loyal customers. However, it is difficult to make someone happy if you do not know that person. The information you get on Waitr will help you to understand your customers and to alter your marketing strategies for the best results.
