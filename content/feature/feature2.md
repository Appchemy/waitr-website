Customer Notifications

Your customer will get an SMS-notification once their order is ready for collection.

This will help with the following:

* Reduce traffic congestion on your premises
* Allow the customer to carry on with other responsibilities while waiting for their order to be ready
* Avoid unnecessary phone call enquiries which can be time-consuming and frustrating at times.

You can also use this feature for communicating information regarding business operations and promotions.
